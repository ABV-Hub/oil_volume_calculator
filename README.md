Probabilistic volumetric calculator for oil and gas resources during exploration using the Monte Carlo simulation method

There are two files, one for gas and one for oil. Else, use the Jupyter notebook as it includes both.
The Monte Carlo simulation is a widely used method in the oil and gas industry to calculate volumes of hydrocarbon initially in place during exploration. For a given iteration, the simulation tests all scenarios and gives a probabilistic distribution of values. We are mostly interested in P90, P50 and the P10 which give us an understanding of the probabilities of having a specific volume of hydrocarbon in the reservoir. Then, these volumes are subject to extensive economic evaluation to judge the commerciality of the project.

There are a couple of expensive software that can do the same job as this program. I have written this code, however, in order to calculate volumes without paying for expensive software while at the same time controlling what goes in the program.

Please feel free to send me comments or suggestions for modification
